# Backend README

This is the backend of the project.

To run the server locally first you need to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can run the server with:

```bash
npm run start
```

In order to be available to successfully run the server, you need to have a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory. 

You can ask @Jorpeser for the `.env` file.
